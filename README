SetUP:
npm start => to start the server and the db
npm jest => to run the tests

DB:
I used a model based on Postgresql using TypeOrm
The database connexion is set up in the index.ts but I didn't really tried to run it, since it's not
what really matters here, what I try to communicate is how I viewed the use case and how I tried to solve it
